[Documentation and Live example](http://fortesinformatica.github.io/Sideshow)

Sideshow is a powerful javascript library which aims to reduce your user's
learning curve by providing a way to create step-by-step interactive helps.

 * Explain the features of your application
 * Control your end-user's interaction with your UI
 * Use Markdown to create formatted step descriptions
 * Emphasize what you're explaining in each step (a button, grid, dropdown,
   form, the whole screen, and so forth) by surrounding it with a fully
   adaptable mask.

## Usage

All the files needed to use Sideshow are located under the `distr` folder.

  1. In your HTML, include Sideshow script and the stylesheet.

     **Note**: The stylesheet must be in the `head` and all the scripts
     (including your own Tutorial scripts) in the bottom of your `body` tag.

     **Note 2**: See the [`examples/`](./examples/) directory for a real example.

  2. Create (and also add a reference in your HTML) a `sideshow.config.js` file
     with this content:

     ```js
     Sideshow.config.language = "en";
     Sideshow.init();
     ```

     **Note**: For now, Sideshow only supports `en` (american english), `pt-br`
     (brazilian portuguese), `es` (spanish, translated by Luis Alfaro de la
     Fuente, thanks!) and `fr`.

  3. Create your tutorials and import each one in your HTML after the Sideshow
     script.

### Creating a Tutorial

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  name: "introducing_sideshow",
  title: "Introducing Sideshow",
  description: "Introducing the main features and concepts of Sideshow. ",
  estimatedTime: "10 Minutes",
  affects: [
    // This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like "http://www.foo.com/bar#messages"
    { hash: "#messages" },
    // This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like "http://www.foo.com/adm/orders"
    { route: "/adm/orders", caseSensitive: true },
    // Here we could do any checking to infer if this tutorial is eligible the current screen/context.
    // After this checking, just return a boolean indicating if this tutorial will be available.
    () => $(".grid").length > 0
  ]
});
```

### Defining a Storyline
A storyline is the sequence of steps of some tutorial.

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  //...
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      title: "Hello Sideshow.",
      text: "This is an oversimplified example."
    },
    {
      title: "The end",
      text: "What a pity =(."
    }
  ]
});
```

### Step: A complete example

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  //...
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      title: "The log out button.",
      text: "Click this button if you want to log out of the system.",
      subject: "#user_details_panel",
      targets: "#user_details_panel > .logout"
    }
  ]
});
```

###Using Markdown

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  //...
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      title: "Markdown is pretty cool!",
      text: "This step uses [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for **text formatting**.",
      format: "markdown"
    }
  ]
});
```

### Completing Conditions
Completing conditions are conditions to be satisfied in order to proceed to the next step.

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      title: "Choose a name for your project",
      text: "Enter a name for your project.",
      completingConditions: [
        () => $("#project_name").val().length > 5
      ]
    },
    //...
  ]
});
```

### Auto continue
By setting the autoContinue flag to true, Sideshow proceeds automaticaly when the completing conditions are satisfied.

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      title: "Choose a name for your project",
      text: "Enter a name for your project.",
      completingConditions: [
        () => $("#project_name").val().length > 5
      ],
      autoContinue: true
    },
    //...
  ]
});
```

### Events
You can perform some action or do some preparation for the next step, or anything you want which can be done programatically.

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  //...
  listeners: {
    beforeWizardStarts() {
      //What goes here will be executed before the first step of this tutorial
    },
    afterWizardEnds() {
      //What goes here will be executed after the last step of this tutorial
    }
  }
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      title: "Foo bar",
      text: "An example of step just to illustrate how to use step events.",
      listeners: {
        beforeStep(){
          //What goes here will be executed before this step
        },
        afterStep(){
          //What goes here will be executed after this step
        }
      }
    },
    //...
  ]
});
```

### Skipping a step

When entering some step you can do some verification to skip the step
automatically.

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  //...
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      //...
      skipIf: () => $("#groups").children().length > 0
    },
    //...
  ]
});
```

### Jumping to other step
You can jump to other step by its position (1-based) or its unique name.

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
    //...
}).storyLine({
  showStepPosition: true,
  steps: [
    {
      //...
      listeners: {
        beforeStep(){
          if ($("#groups").children().length > 0) {
            Sideshow.gotoStep("the_end"); //we're jumping to the step named "the_end"
          } else if ($("#people").children().length > 0) {
            Sideshow.gotoStep(7); //we're jumping to the seventh step in this Wizard storyline
          }
        }
      }
    },
    //...
    {
      name: "the_end",
      title: "The end",
      //...
    }
  ]
});
```

### Tutorial Eligibility

When a user invokes Sideshow, a list with the tutorials available for the
current screen/context is shown. Sideshow knows if a tutorial is eligible for
some screen by testing the `affects` conditions of each registered tutorial. If
one of the conditions are met, the tutorial is listed.

```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  //...
  affects: [
    // This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like "http://www.foo.com/bar#messages"
    { hash: "#messages" },
    // This tutorial would be eligible for URLs like "http://www.foo.com/adm/orders"
    { route: "/adm/orders", caseSensitive: true },
    // Here we could do any checking to infer if this tutorial is eligible the
    // current screen/context. After this checking, just return a boolean
    // indicating if this tutorial will be available.
    () => $(".grid").length > 0
  ]
}).storyLine({
  //...
});
```

### Tutorial Preparation Function

Even if a tutorial isn't eligible for some screen, by using a preparation
function a user can access this tutorial from any point of your system/site (by
pressing shift-F2).


```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  // ...
  preparation(doneCallback){
    // if your app is a SPA, you could do some sort of redirection and call the
    // doneCallback function after the page is loaded.
  }
}).storyLine({
  // ...
});
```

### Related Tutorials

You can also define relationships between tutorials, this way, after finishing a
tutorial, the user sees a list of others related to this.


```js
Sideshow.registerWizard({
  // ...
  // after finishing the current wizard, the user will be guided to related tutorials
  relatedWizards: [
    "creating_user",
    "groups_and_permissions",
    "security_settings"
  ]
}).storyLine({
  //...
});
```

### Skipping the Intro screen (the tutorial list) automatically if there's just one tutorial available for a given context

In the sideshow.config.js file, set the `autoSkipIntro` option to true:

```js
Sideshow.config.autoSkipIntro = true;
//...other configuration options
Sideshow.init();
```


## Invoking Sideshow

 *  The user can access the tutorials available for the current screen by
    pressing `F2`.
 *  The user can access the tutorials available for the current screen +
    tutorials for other screens with a preparation function by pressing
    `shift+F2`.
